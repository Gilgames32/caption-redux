# Caption Redux

A GIF caption generator mimicing the iFunny caption style, popular on Discord, Reddit, and similar pits of the internet.

This project is a complete rewrite and extension of [kubinka0505's iFunny-Captions](https://github.com/kubinka0505/iFunny-Captions) project (archived).

## Feature list

- caption GIFs, videos and images
- options to configure fonts, emoji styles, colors, etc.
- support for Discord emotes (in `<:floraSmug:1112288234488201307>` format)
- optimizations for smaller filesizes (also configurable)
- supports both local and online files
- extra support for popular GIF hosting sites (Tenor, Giphy, etc.)
- option for transparent GIF captions



## Installation
For advanced users:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gilgames32/caption-redux.git
cd caption-redux
pip install -r requirements. txt
```
You **must** have [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/). [Gifsicle](https://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/) is highly recommended but optional. [Pngcrush](https://pmt.sourceforge.io/pngcrush/) is negligible but also supported.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> These packages must be added to the PATH for them to work.

*Dummy guide soon.*

## Usage
Run `caption-redux.py`. Optionally you can use arguments, see `-h`.
- `-i <image link>` path or direct URL to the image
- `-t <caption text>` the caption text
- `-a`: preserve GIF transparency (uses the legacy method, a bit slower) 
- `-g`: force GIF output (even if the input was a video or a static image)

Configuration guide (`config.json`):
- `safe_mode`: if enabled, captioning of local files will be disabled
- `loglevel`: for devs
- `text`
    - `font`: path to the font
    - `font_size`: font size
    - `wrap_width`: maximum amount of columns per line
    - `line_spacing`: spacing between lines
    - `padding`: padding of the text inside the caption
    - `minimum_line_width`: minimum line width
- `color`
    - `background`: the color of the background
    - `text`: the color of the text
- `emoji_style`: the style of the emojis, supported styles are `twitter`, `google`, `facebook` and `apple`
- `optimization`
    - `pngcrush`
        - `enabled`: if enabled and Pngcrush is installed, the result will be compressed
    - `gifsicle`
        - `enabled`: if enabled and Gifsicle is installed, the result will be compressed
        - `compression`: compression scale (bigger means more compression artifacts)
        - `colors`: number of colors (2-256)
        - `fps`: maximum framerate (if the input is lower than this, the original framerate will be used)
    - `video`
        - `enabled`: if enabled, the result will be compressed
        - `fps`: maximum framerate (if the input is lower than this, the original framerate will be used)
        - `bitrate`: the bitrate of the output video
        - `height`: the height of the output video (excluding the caption)

## Plans
> easier install

## Motivation

This project focuses on extended functionality, faster generation and cleaner code compared to it's alternatives (such as esmBot, the now archived repository or the official iFunny generator).

Contributions, pull requests, reviews, suggestions, issues and whatnot are welcome!
